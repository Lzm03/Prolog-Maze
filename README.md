# Prolog-Maze Project

## Overview
The Prolog-Maze project is a Prolog-based system designed to solve complex mazes. Using logic programming and search algorithms, it navigates through grid-based mazes to find the most efficient path from start to finish, considering various constraints such as limited energy and obstacles.

## Repository Structure
- `AI-CW`: Contains the main coursework files and the logic for the maze-solving algorithms.
- `Grid_world_lab`: Includes laboratory files that provide a simulated environment for testing the maze-solving agents.
- `README.md`: This document provides an overview and guidance on how to set up and use the Prolog-Maze solver.

## Getting Started
To run the maze solver, clone this repository and ensure you have a Prolog interpreter installed on your system.

### Prerequisites
